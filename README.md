## Introduction
IMGDD is a simple image hosting program.

It powers a toy image hosting project that began in early 2023. The source code was requested by some users, so I decided to make it available after a bit of refactoring and cleanup.

As of February 2025, the project has been handling more than 1 TB of traffic per day and over 4.2 million requests per day. If traffic continues to grow, I may need to stop accepting new images. This project also serves as an alternative for those who want to host their own image hosting service.

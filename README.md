# IMGDD

## Introduction
IMGDD is a simple image hosting program.

It is used to power a toy image hosting project started at the start of 2023. The source code of the project has been requested by some users, so I decided to make the source code available after some refactoring and cleanup.

As of Feb of 2025, the project has being seeing more than 1T of traffic per day, and more than 4.2 million request per day. I may need to stop receiving new images at some point if the traffic continues to grow. This project serves as an alternative for those who want to host their own image hosting service.
